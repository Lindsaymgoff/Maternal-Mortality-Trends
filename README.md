# Maternal Mortality Rates Analysis (2019 - March 2025)

## 📌 Overview
Maternal mortality has become an increasingly urgent topic in public health conversations, especially as more articles, research studies, and lived experiences highlight ongoing concerns among African American women regarding the safety and equity of maternal care.
